# CBC-Decryption

Collaboration wiht IoKog

Suppose an attacker wishes to steal secret information from our target web site crypto-class.appspot.com. The attacker suspects that the web site embeds encrypted customer data in URL parameters such as this: http://crypto-class.appspot.com/po?er= f20bdba6ff29eed7b046d1df9fb7000058b1ffb4210a580f748b4ac714c001bd4a61044426fb515dad3f21f18aa577c0bdf302936266926ff37dbf7035d5eeb4
when a decrypted CBC ciphertext ends in an invalid pad the web server returns a 403 error code (forbidden request). When the CBC padding is valid, but the message is malformed, the web server returns a 404 error code (URL not found).

Armed with this information your goal is to decrypt the ciphertext listed above. To do so you can send arbitrary HTTP requests to the web site of the form

http://crypto-class.appspot.com/po?er="your ciphertext here" and

observe the resulting error code. The padding oracle will let you decrypt the given ciphertext one byte at a time. To decrypt a single byte you will need to send up to 256 HTTP requests to the site. Keep in mind that the first ciphertext block is the random IV. The decrypted message is ASCII encoded.
